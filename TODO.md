# TODO

## 1st phase: Getting this ready to be published

- Update all versions
- Add automatic publish GitHub workflows

## 2nd phase: Find some alternative mods

There are some mods that are not available for Fabric and are Forge mods or have been for old versions of MineCraft and are not available for the newer versions. We need to find some alternatives for them to add to the modpack:

- **MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod**: Adding new decoration stuff
- **Biomes O' Plenty**: Changing the overworld generation
- **Dehydration**: This currently exists, but it's too complicated. We need to add a simpler mod for dehydration
- **Additional Mobs**: Adds lots of new cool mobs but is not available for 1.19.2

## 3rd phase: Create logo and symbol

We need to create a logo and also organize some documentation for our modpack.

## 4th phase: Create some mods

There are some mods that we need to create to make our modpack more interesting.

1. A mod to add Paper and Quill to the game.
We need a kind of paper which acts like book and quill and can be signed by players. Also it should be stackable.

2. A mod to add Alcoholic drinks to the game.
We need lots of functionalities for it to make it the most complete mod for alcoholic drinks in MineCraft.

3. A mod to add different smokes to the game.
And also the tools to use them. And maybe some new plants to use in their crafting recipes.

4. A mod to completely change the ender dragon boss fight.
Currently this boss fight is pretty shit and easy. We have to make it hard as fuck and more interesting.
