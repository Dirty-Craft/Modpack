## Mods to create

1. A mod to add Paper and Quill to the game.
We need a kind of paper which acts like book and quill and can be signed by players.
Also it should be stackable.
And available with different colors.

2. A mod to add alcoholic drinks to the game.
We need lots of functionalities for it to make it the most complete mod for alcoholic drinks in MineCraft.
Also we should make it compatible with other mods that add new fruits, like Croptopia.
