## 1st step: Create logo and symbol
We need to create a logo and also organize some documentation for our modpack.

## 2nd step: Create some mods
There are some mods that we need to create to make our modpack more interesting.
We're planning to create all of them in long term.

1. A mod to add Paper and Quill to the game.
We need a kind of paper which acts like book and quill and can be signed by players.
Also it should be stackable
And available with different colors.

2. A mod to add alcoholic drinks to the game.
We need lots of functionalities for it to make it the most complete mod for alcoholic drinks in MineCraft.
Also we should make it compatible with other mods that add new fruits, like Croptopia.

3. A mod to add different smokes to the game.
And also the tools to use them. And maybe some new plants to use in their crafting recipes.

4. A mod to completely change the ender dragon boss fight.
Currently this boss fight is pretty shit and easy. We have to make it hard as fuck and more interesting.
